It looks like you don’t have an SSH private/public key pair (`id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`) in your `~/.ssh` directory. To resolve the issue, you’ll need to generate a new SSH key pair and then add the public key to your GitHub account.

### Step 1: Generate a New SSH Key Pair

1. **Generate SSH Key Pair:**
   - Run the following command to generate a new SSH key pair:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   Replace `"your_email@example.com"` with your GitHub email address.

2. **Follow the Prompts:**
   - You’ll be prompted to enter a file in which to save the key. Press `Enter` to accept the default location (`/home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa`).
   - If prompted, enter a passphrase for added security or press `Enter` to leave it empty.

3. **Start the SSH Agent:**
   - After generating the key, start the SSH agent:

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

4. **Add the SSH Key to the Agent:**
   - Add your SSH private key to the agent:

   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

### Step 2: Add the SSH Key to GitHub

1. **Copy the Public Key:**
   - Copy the contents of your new public key file:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

   Copy the output to your clipboard.

2. **Log in to GitHub:**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in.

3. **Navigate to SSH and GPG Keys:**
   - Go to [SSH and GPG keys settings](https://github.com/settings/keys).

4. **Add a New SSH Key:**
   - Click on **New SSH key**.
   - Paste the copied public key into the "Key" field.
   - Add a descriptive title and click **Add SSH key**.

### Step 3: Test the SSH Connection

1. **Test Your SSH Connection:**
   - Verify that you can connect to GitHub using SSH:

   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

   You should see a message like:

   ```
   Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
   ```

### Step 4: Push Your Changes

1. **Push to Remote Repository:**
   - Try pushing your changes again:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

This should resolve the issue and allow you to push to your GitHub repository. If you encounter any further issues, feel free to ask!
